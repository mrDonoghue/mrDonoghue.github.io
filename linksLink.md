## Today's class:
* REMINDER: [If you haven't done digital app prep (including trying the app demo), you MUST do that!](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap-2021/updates/digital-exams/download-testing-app) Allegedly, the problem is fixed now. Try again, and let me know if it's still broken.
* **First log in to Coding Rooms** [here](https://app.codingrooms.com) and **THEN** [join our new live classroom](https://app.codingrooms.com/c-join/c/H1dyhXVMnttI)
* [Recursive searching and sorting](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit10-Recursion/topic-10-2-recursive-search-sort.html)
* [Recursion practice!](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=69087)
* Continue on to the Exam Prep section below! Exam is 7 days away!
   
* If you finish Array and ArrayList and 2D array practice continue on to the Exam Prep section below! Exam is 11 days away!
## Exam Prep
* I strongly recommend finishing the practices we've been working on! A good chunk of the exam will involve arrays, ArrayLists, or 2D arrays somehow
   * Required: [Array Practice!](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=67882) If you haven't finished yet, please do! You might find it helpful to look at [this live classroom](https://app.codingrooms.com/c-join/c/2sU6YiD8fCxC) or the [runestone chapter on arrays](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit6-Arrays/toctree.html)
   * Required: [ArrayList Practice!](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=68479) You might like to look at [this live classroom](https://app.codingrooms.com/c-join/c/qfPlbysPpkC1) or the [runestone chapter on ArrayLists](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit7-ArrayList/toctree.html)
   * Required: [2D Array Practice!](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=68727). You might like to look at [this live classroom](https://app.codingrooms.com/c-join/c/2fvnIP6gCmAg) or the [runestone chapter on 2D arrays](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit8-2DArray/toctree.html)

- Try some FRQ practice instead. For each of the below bullets, I'm linking to the first FRQ on Runestone for each type. **If you move to the next page, there are more FRQ of each type.** Remember that Runestone is a textbook and every page has arrow buttons to the left and right that let you move page to page.
   - [FRQ 1 Practice](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit4-Iteration/FRQcalendar.html) (ifs and loops and such. Remember that you might have already done some of these)
   - [FRQ 2 practice](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit5-Writing-Classes/FRQstepTracker.html) (making a class from scratch like AdditionPattern)
   - [FRQ 3 practice, array version](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit6-Arrays/topic-6-4-array-algorithms.html)  AND [FRQ 3 practice, ArrayList version](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit7-ArrayList/topic-7-4-arraylist-algorithms.html) (Any given exam will have an FRQ 3 that is either based on arrays or on ArrayLists. In either case, you will probably have to write a couple of methods working with 2D arrays, likely involving writing nested for loops to traverse through every element in the 2D array)
   - [FRQ 4 practice](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Unit8-2DArray/grayImageA.html). (writing code working with 2D arrays)
- If you want even more FRQ Practice try the [2020 Practice Exam 1 FRQ on AP Classroom](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/assessments/assignments/34334603). This is an entire FRQ section complete with FRQ1, FRQ2, FRQ3, and FRQ4 style questions.
- If you want multiple choice practice check out [Unit 12](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/Tests/toctree.html) and [Unit 13](https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csawesome/TimedTests/toctree.html) of Runestone. There are "practice exams" 20 questions at a time. Remember that the real exam will have 40 multiple choice questions.
- If you've been doing the [Multiple Choice Progress Checks](https://gist.github.com/mrDonoghue/c653915e0baa63fc2b65a6278dc7a190), but haven't finished, do those! If you don't know what you don't know and/or need multiple choice practice this is a great choice
- If you need to **learn**, AP Classroom has videos for every single topic, including those we haven't done yet! If you go [here](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/8/home), you should see videos underneath the Instructional Resource Search area. Note that you can select from each unit individually
